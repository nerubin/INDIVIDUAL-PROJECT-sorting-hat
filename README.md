# The name of my project is "The Sorting Hat 2.0"
I created a Sorting Hat website that lets users input a student's name and sort them into a random Hogwarts house (Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin). After sorting, a card is generated displaying the studentâ€™s name, their house, and a color-coded design based on the house (e.g., green for Slytherin). Users can also expel students, which replaces their card with a message: 'The Dark Lord awaits your devotion!' while still showing their name and original house. Additionally, I added filter buttons for each house and an 'All' button to easily view students by house or see everyone at once.

## Features
  -Dynamic Student Creation: Adding a new student creates an object, which is stored in an array and displayed on the webpage.
  -House-Themed Design: Each student's card is styled with a color that corresponds to their assigned house.
  -Expel Functionality: An expel button allows users to remove a student from the main array and update the display accordingly.
  -Voldemort's Army Section: Expelled students are moved to a separate section with uniquely styled cards to distinguish them from current Hogwarts students.
